        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Wild Current Rafting was founded by a small group of outdoor enthusiasts who shared a
            deep love for
            rivers and adventure. What began as weekend trips with friends quickly grew into a
            passion for
            sharing the thrill of rafting with others. With a single raft and a strong respect for
            nature, the
            company started guiding small groups through local waterways.

            Over the years, Wild Current Rafting expanded its routes, equipment, and team of
            experienced guides.
            Despite this growth, the company has remained committed to its original values: safety,
            teamwork,
            and unforgettable experiences on the water. Today, Wild Current Rafting continues to
            welcome
            adventurers of all skill levels, creating memories one river at a time.</p>
